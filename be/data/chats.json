So, when you arrive, after initial triage, a nurse will evaluate how serious your injury is. If it's urgent, you\u2019ll be seen quicker. After that, you'll go through registration, and then it\u2019s usually a waiting game until a doctor can examine you. They might order some tests to get a better look at what's going on before deciding on the best treatment for you. If you've got any specific parts of the process you\u2019re curious about, just let me know!",
