A nurse will assess your condition and assign a triage level from one to five, with one being the most serious. After that, you\u2019ll go through registration, where you\u2019ll share some basic info to create your medical record. Then, you\u2019ll likely wait in the waiting room for a bit. Depending on how busy the department is and how urgent your case is, the wait can be short or a bit longer. When it\u2019s your turn, a doctor will examine you and might order some tests to help figure out what\u2019s going on. After that, they\u2019ll work out a treatment plan for you. Just remember, I\u2019m here to help guide you through the process and answer any questions you might have!",
